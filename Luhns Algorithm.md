Approach:
Luhn_verify - for this assignment we had to use the algorithm such that the code entered results in giving the user validation for the credit card. When the user is asked to enter a credit card number, the program validates the number using a checksum which is used to detect any error. The code contains statements like a loop, return, print, and functions like range. The loop is used so that the code is repeated a certain number of times. Return is used to give the results back to the user. The range function tells the code to run a certain number of times. Once the code is successfully written, the user can check if the credit card number entered was valid or not.

Luhn_generate - for this assignment we had to use the algorithm such that the code entered results in giving the user a missing digit or the 16th digit for the 15-digit credit card number entered. To generate the number, we worked from right to left. The code calculates the sum starting from the right side to the left with every odd number getting multiplied by 2. The number is generated when the modulo is subtracted from the sum and at the end, their answer is subtracted from 10 which results in the 16th number of a credit card.

Bugs: No bugs found.
