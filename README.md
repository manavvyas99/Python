Approach: 
catalan.py: This week there were two assignments in which first one was about catalan numbers. In this asignment, a function called catalan_number was defined. This function was given a value of 1 to initialize. After assigning the value, a loop was created for the k value ranging from 2 to n. For this, a formula was assigned to calculate the catalan number for a certain number in a rounded figure with round function. main() function was defined in which catalan_number was called to provide us values from 2 to 15. __name__ function used to call main().

pascal.py: Just like catalan number assignment, we will define a function for this one. a condition statement was used for k value from 0 to n along with a condition that will return 1 if condition is satisfied. In case of condition is not satisified, function gets recalled with a different argument.Just like above assignment, main function was defined in which loop ranges from 1 to 10 with another loop from 1 to i + 1.
