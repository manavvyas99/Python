Module Info: Module 7 Midterm Assignment - Frequency Analysis. Due Date is 10/16/2022

Approach: 
freq_analysis.py: The assignment was interesting yet lot of things were going on while forming the code. We were given two tet file which were cipher and frequency files. To start, the content from the cipher text was pasted into the visual code under a variable. A function was creted to count the cfrequency from the text. Later on it was converted into set from a string. For this, an empty dictionary was created to store frequency counts of each characters from the given file. Then a loop was created for characters from the string. .count used to count frequency. Appended the key and its value to the dictionary. Later it will return nby using return. Another empty dictionary was created for the text file which will have loop to read each line and split the letter and its frequency by using a ":". A loop was created to shift till 26 shift possibilities. .upper was used to change letters to upper case. When the possibilities are generated, the meaningful message will be stored in plain text. ord() and chr() were used to return unicode and character from unicode respectively. To sum everything up, print() was applied to give us the desired results and would break after meaningful message is displayed.

Bugs: none
