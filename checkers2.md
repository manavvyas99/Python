Approach: 
checkers.py - This week's assignment was about making a checkers game that would provide user with the moves of pieces. For this, we were provided with two files which had coordinates of the pieces. These coordinates were splitted with commas. Then append was used to insert value into lists. Then a nested list was created for both colored pieces. After maiing lists, for loops were created to get the moves of both pieces by skipping the opposite colors coordinates. Variables were assigned that would print the moves later on. After that, variable were made which  would provide previous and next positions of red and black pieces. Then the moves were determined based on single or double jump. Conditions were introduced to check who captured and winner was later printed. 

Bugs - none
