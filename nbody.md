Approach: 
nbody.py - This week's assignment was a bit lengthy but very interesting. In this week's assignment, we had to write code that predicts the position of planets after a certain time. We were given 5 celestial objects namely Earth, Sun, Mercury, Venus, and Mars at x position, y position, x velocity, y velocity, and mass respectively. We then had to nest it. Using the formula provided in the pdf we converted it into code such that it calculates force, acceleration, velocity, and resulting position. In the end, the positions of planets and stars were printed in the result.
