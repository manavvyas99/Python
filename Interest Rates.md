Module Info:  Module 2 Assignment: Interest Rates are due on 09/11/2022 at 11:59 EST

Approach
interest.py: For this assignment, I typed a script that would calculate the total interest paid from the information entered by the user. The variables used were p, r, t, and n for principal, rate, term, and compound respectively. The formula typed in python then uses the numbers entered by the user to calculate the total paid and from the total another formula then calculates interest. After using the assigned variables and formula, I implemented those variables into the print() which would inform the user of the results.

rate.py: For this assignment, I used the Total from interest.py and used p, r, t, and n variables. After entering the numbers for their respective variables, the formula calculates the rate which is in percentage. Using the variables and formula, I then implemented them into the string using print() which would inform the user of the results.

Known Bugs: While typing/running, no bugs were to be found.
