Module Info: Module 1 Assignment: Hello World! Due on 09/04/2022 at 11:59 EST

Approach: 
hello.py - For this assignment, I typed a script that would say Hello, Joe! when the user is prompted. The variable used in this assignment is Name which the user can type in. After using the assigned variable, I implemented that variable into the print() which would print Hello, Joe! when the script runs.

due_date.py - In this assignment, I used 5 variables instead of one. The variables used were Month, Day, Year, Time, Hour, and Time. Using these variables I then implemented them into a string or str using print(). The result "Module 1 is due on 09/04/2022 at 11:59 EST" was achieved by adding + to the variables while adding a statement.
